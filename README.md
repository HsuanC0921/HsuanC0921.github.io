# My Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog, powered by Jekyll and styled with the Minimal Mistakes theme. This GitHub Pages site serves as a platform where I share insights, experiences, and projects related to my academic and professional journey in technology and education.

## About This Blog

This blog is built using Jekyll, a static site generator that's perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. I chose the Minimal Mistakes theme for its clean and minimal aesthetic, which helps in keeping the focus on the content.

Feel free to explore the posts and learn more about the fascinating world of technology and AI as I navigate through my senior project and beyond.

Thank you for visiting!
